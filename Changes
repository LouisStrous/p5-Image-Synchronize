Revision history for Perl extension Image::Synchronize.

1.0  2018-08-02
     First public version.

1.1  2018-08-24
     FIX: --time with a timestamp or timerange for target was broken.

1.2  2018-04-25

     - FIX: Reject only GPS tags from the EXIF group (because they are
       incomplete), instead of accepting only GPS tags from the
       Composite group.  So now GPS tags from the XMP group are
       accepted.
