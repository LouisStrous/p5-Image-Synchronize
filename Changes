Revision history for Perl extension Image::Synchronize.

1.0  2018-08-02
     First public version.

1.1  2018-08-24
     FIX: --time with a timestamp or timerange for target was broken.

1.2  2018-04-25

     - FIX: Reject only GPS tags from the EXIF group (because they are
       incomplete), instead of accepting only GPS tags from the
       Composite group.  So now GPS tags from the XMP group are
       accepted.

     - If the only thing that would be changed in a file is the imsync
       version number, then suppress that change.

     - Report the number of non-zero modification time offset changes.

     - Restrict search to depth 1 when looking for subdirectories.
